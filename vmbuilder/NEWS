0.12.5
  * Ported debian so that users can also runb debian-vm-builder

0.12.4:

  * Revive firstscripts plugins. This fixes the --firstboot and --firstlogin
    options, both of which went missing with 0.12.
  * Make Plugin.install_file work in non-context plugins (plugins that are not
    Distros or Hypervisors).
  * Do a slightly better job at cleaning up after ourselves by removing the
    distro chroot by default and removing the temporary root mount point.
  * Revive QEMu hypervisor.

0.12.3:

 * Reworked the way timezones and locales are handled. This fixes an
   actual problem with /etc/localtime not being set correctly, and fixes
   a theoretical problem with people not running VMBuilder on Ubuntu.
 * Resurrect -o (--overwrite) which went missing with 0.12.0.
 * Resurrect Xen support which went missing with 0.12.0.

0.12.2:

 * Moved test directory under VMBuilder/ and include it in the tarball.
 * Revive ubuntu-vm-builder (which rotted during the 0.11 -> 0.12 transition)
 * Skip tests that need root, if not run as root.
 * Fix installing onto logical volumes.
 * Fix --raw handling.
 * Refresh documenation in disk.py
 * Improve handling of non-string settings from command line and config files.
 * A big bunch of cleanups, most thanks to pyflakes.

 * Update postinst plugin to 0.12 API.
 * If trying to install a file to a nonexisting directory, the directory
